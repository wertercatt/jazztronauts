This is a dumping ground for various extracted tables and variables that were previously hardcoded.
Eventually, I'd like for these to be copied into garrysmod/data/jazztronauts/cfg on the first boot and then loaded from there
so that other addons or the player/server operator can modify them as they see fit.
