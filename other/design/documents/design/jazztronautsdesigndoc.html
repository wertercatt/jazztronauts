The goal is to explore and find items in randomly selected user levels, using a suite of custom tools and mechanics to enable the player a greater variety of options to traverse any given level. Upon completion of all the goals in a given level, the players will return to a hub world called The Bar where they can level up their tools and acquire new assets to further help explore and create fun scenarios to just generally have a good time looking at weird old bsp files that may be otherwise never played seriously again. Jazztronauts has a simple story and cast of new characters to help players get into the mindset of exploring these levels for a purpose, serving to eventually get far enough to see An Ending.</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12 c9">Design Tenets</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Reward the player for being clever and using mechanics in an unexpected way</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Embrace how janky the engine is, and allow it to break down.</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">The treadmill is there to give the illusion of progression, NOT to limit the player</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">Make moving around in a space fun, don&rsquo;t make it a shortcut.</span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c6 c2"><span class="c14 c7 c3"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c14 c7 c3">Major states of Jazztronauts:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c14 c7 c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c7 c3">Opening</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The game opens with a fake garry&rsquo;s mod horror map. It is deceptively standard fare for gmod, and the scares should be very ineffective if present at all. The entire time if the player looks and observes the environment carefully there will, at points, be early hints of what&rsquo;s going on in the form of silhouettes running across catwalks or other very subtle visual cues. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the halfway point the players will witness a new toolgun of some sort fall into the room they are standing in, landing in a clearly visible and telegraphed area inviting them to pick it up. At this point they have the kidnapping tool and we let them use it without explaining anything for a few moments so they can puzzle out how it works, but not WHAT it does. This stage is important because this is the only chance we will get to give them a controlled scenario to experiment with the gun, and as long as they get some sort of feel for it then we&rsquo;ve won. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So now they have this new gun, further down the road they come to a long hallway with a cargobay visible behind an open shutter at the end of the hall. As they approach, a strange bus crashes through the wall out of view and comes skidding to a halt, framed by the shutter at the end of the hall. A few moments later, a cat person jumps into view and is seen searching the room for something. As she scans the room, she locks eyes with the player and shouts to unseen companions, followed by 3 more cats appearing into view. They run towards the player and via a Trigger volume we capture them and force them into a cutscene. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The cutscene goes from a hl1 callback where gordon gets kidnapped by hgrunts, to a scene of them talking next to the bus, to the player on the bus with the cats happily chatting about something. At this 3rd vignette the player is no longer groggy and gets to witness the bus driving into a portal where the wall is broken in first person. Fade to white, title card. Smash cut to scenes of them driving through a jazz void while Que Chevera plays, use this opportunity to sell the mood and give in-universe title cards. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c3">Main Game Loop</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">The player wakes up in a stage area connected to the Bar and are forced to watch the cats explain what they are doing there, perhaps again through a forced cutscene via hammer, or the Jazztronauts dialogue system (</span><span class="c7 c3">see mechanics scope</span><span class="c3">). After they leave the theater and enter the bar proper we need to make sure they at least interact with the shop systems at least once and understand where everything is, and give them some free money to get started. Check </span><span class="c7 c3">What&rsquo;s In The Hub?</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;For context of what rooms exist.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now that introductions are out of the way it&#39;s just normal Jazztronauts loop until the end of game. The loop consists of returning home, going to level up their tools at the shop, restocking exploration assets, and checking to see if they&rsquo;ve unlocked any conversation with one of the 4 jazz cats. We&rsquo;ll call this the buy phase from now on. At any point during the buy phase a player may go out to the bus station and reroll the next map that the group will go to, once they find a promising one everyone may go about their business until they are ready to explore, in which case they all physically get on the bus and once we see every player there the bus drives off and we have a vignette of the bus on a highway in the jazz dimension, and we give them as much info about the map as possible. This extra stage exists to give hype them up and give them one last chance to cancel and get anything they forgot in the buy phase. After an amount of time the bus drives off into the distance and we load the next map.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Next comes the Exploration Phase, upon loading I suggest we do a mario sunshine style camera panning over the map so they can get a really fast idea of what the layout looks like, and any landmarks they can spot (</span><span class="c7 c3">see polish scope</span><span class="c1">). Upon loading we programmatically scatter 5 Orb Shards, and the immediate goal is to collect all 5 shards. Upon collection of them, The Main Orb spawns in a random spot that we telegraph with a smash cut that all players are forced to view. This hurdle exists as a test to see how well they understand the levels layout, and if they can reach it then they&rsquo;ve won the map and the bus arrives to drive them back home.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Aside from collecting orbs, during the exploration phase the players may steal any arbitrary props, npcs, and other entities from the map using a toolgun. The stolen assets are either broken down into money, or added to a collection room of some sort (</span><span class="c7 c3">see mechanics scope/polish scope</span><span class="c3">). Players should be incentivized to steal assets from a level out of entertainment value, and to allow them to buy more dumb garbage to use in maps and have fun with, while allowing them a greater degree of agency over their own movement. Aside from blanket stealing props, the players have a checklist of things they need to get to see a given Jazz Cat Dialogue Event (</span><span class="c7 c3">see sunabouzu&rsquo;s shameful dating sim corner</span><span class="c3">). Any item stolen will first go towards furthering jazz cat events, and if the thing they stole isn&#39;t needed for any event, then it goes towards normal asset rules. A preliminary list of exploration tools and assets can be found at </span><span class="c7 c3">Mechanics Scope.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At the end of the exploration phase we have another bus vignette just like the one they used to confirm the map for the last time, a bus in a jazz dimension. Here though we show how much money everyone got, if the mission was successful, and any other humorous metrics we can track (like most kleiners stolen or something). After an amount of time, the bus drives off into the distance and we go back to the start of the loop and it happens all over again.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c7 c3">Finale</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">After a specific amount of Orbs are collected, the number which will be determined based on playtesting and developer opinion, the finale will be triggered and the next map will be force-set to the finale bsp. The finale is one cutscene, where the bus falls off the jazz highway and all the players are free floating down into darkness. After a worrying amount of time, we see an infinity cube framed behind a grand display of light and power. There, is a prog band playing the Eternal Set Of Existence, which is the longest song in the known universe and also caused the big bang. The wizened band members have a dialogue, and eventually they give the players some shitty non-advice. Smash cut to the players floating unimpressed in the void, bathed in light, as the jazz cats float around mewling and enjoying the festival. The camera cuts back to the band, as they sigh and agree to tell them The Secret.

Example: the team plays a l4d map and usually there&rsquo;s a spot where a trolley comes across a chasm slowly while they fight off a horde. For obvious reasons, this will halt progression, so instead we need to enable the mindset of scavenging for resources and some basic tools that will let them circumvent broken design. Here is the preliminary list that is completely up for adjustment and change:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-A series of basic ramps and boards that maybe can be welded together to make structures or bridges, or at least stacked on top of each other to make towers to climb.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Abstract mechanisms that cause a very specific thing to happen, example: a pad that will always just launch whatever props are on it up very fast and very far into the sky. Obvious uses for this are making dangerous elevators, or cannons to launch players a very far distance across the map to ease travel times on larger RP maps. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1">-We&rsquo;ll need to brainstorm more of these later at a team pow wow.</span></p><p class="c0 c8 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1">-Should we let them buy items for spawning that they have sitting in the collection room?</span></p><p class="c0 c8 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c2 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1">-Vehicles that are very cheap and can be spawned per the amount of them you&rsquo;ve bought.
